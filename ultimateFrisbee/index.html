      <h2>Watch Your Head</h2>
      <p>Watch your Head
        Ultimate Frisbee is a sport that I never played myself, but it's popularity is something hard to ignore in many
        Midwestern college towns. Students (and people who wish they were still students) spend the few briefs months of
        good
        weather, sprinting down fields, hurling frisbees, and yelling "Stack!!".

      <p>What I find much more entertaining is the large number of people who continue to play when the weather gets
        windy
        and
        the night sky darkens around oh....4:15pm. The sight of frisbees boomeranging in the wind is topped only by the
        knowledge that even when you can't seem, those same plastic discs of death are probably hurtling through the
        dark
        night
        sky at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening.</p>

      <p>Ultimate Frisbee requires a great deal of stamina and dexterity. Not surprisingly, the <abbr
          title="International Olympic Committee">IOC</abbr> " officially recognized
        Ultimate as a sport in 2015. It can go up against other sports for inclusion in Olympic games."</p>
